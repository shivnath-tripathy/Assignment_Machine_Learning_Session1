Ans 1.a) Model building b) Model testing c) Applying the model
 
Ans 2. The standard approach to supervised learning is to split the set of example into the training set and the test. 

Ans 3. In various areas of information science like machine learning, a set of data is used to discover the potentially predictive relationship known as ‘Training Set’. Training set is an examples given to the learner, while Test set is used to test the accuracy of the hypotheses generated by the learner, and it is the set of example held back from the learner. Training set are distinct from Test set. 

Ans 4. Ensemble methods aim at improving the predictive performance of a given statistical learning or model fitting technique. The general principle of ensemble methods is to construct a linear combination of some model fitting method, instead of using a single fit of the method. The bagging can reduce the variance of classifier models, while boosting can reduce both bias and variance.   

Ans 5. Overfitting can be reduced following below steps:
    Add more data.
    Using data augmentation.
    Using architectures that generalize well.
    Adding regularization (mostly dropout, L1/L2 regularization are also possible)
    Reduce architecture complexity.
